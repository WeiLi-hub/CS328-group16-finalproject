## Problem Statement
This project aims to create a model that can distinguish between two types of badminton serves: the overhead serve and the forehand serve. The project uses the mobile device's accelerometer and gyroscope sensors to detect the phone's rotational velocity and acceleration. 

## Potential Applications of the Project
The classification model that has been created has several potential applications. It can help individuals improve their badminton skills by providing feedback on the accuracy and consistency of their serves. The model can also assist coaches and trainers in identifying areas for improvement in their players. Moreover, the model can be utilized in research to analyze and compare the biomechanics of various types of badminton serves. 

## Data Collection, Model Training, and Testing/ Analysis
Data collection for this project involves using a mobile device's accelerometer and gyroscope sensors to collect raw data from users performing different types of badminton serves. The collected data is then processed and transformed into meaningful features using appropriate signal-processing techniques. Model training involves splitting the data into training and testing sets, selecting appropriate classification algorithms, and optimizing hyperparameters. Model validation is then performed using various performance metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. 

## Learnings from the Project
The badminton-serves classification project taught us valuable lessons in several key areas. We encountered the complexities and time-consuming nature of preprocessing data, learned how to classify and train machine learning models, and understood the importance of selecting appropriate features for classification. We also developed data visualization and interpretation skills, using confusion matrices to evaluate the performance of our models. In addition, we gained experience in teamwork and project management, which involved setting goals, dividing tasks, and communicating effectively with team members. 

## How to Improve the Project Further:
To enhance the project, a few areas should be given attention. Firstly, adding more samples of various types of badminton and non-badminton serves to the dataset would diversify the data and enhance the classification model's generalization. Secondly, experimenting with different classification algorithms and ensembling techniques could potentially boost the classification model's accuracy and strength.
